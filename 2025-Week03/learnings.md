So I've been working on getting better at python. I've done a few things.

I've done quite a bit of hackerranks and learned about list comprehensions. They're basically a filter for lists in layman's terms. Below is an example:

```Python
numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

even_numbers = [n for n in numbers if n % 2 == 0]
```

The even numbers list will get all the even numbers in the numbers list. It basically shortens the way we would do this originally.

The next thing I did was a satellite orbit mini-project where I simulated a satellite orbiting earth. I gave the user a few options like boost, refuel, change rotation, etc. I simulated it based on real life metrics but nothing too crazy like actual physics.

I learned how to make classes in python (I've only done this in C++). I also learned about Python's version of constructor's like **init** and **str** .

One thing I need to get used to in python is the self addition to the class. I don't really know why we need it but I am assuming it's so that other functions inside the class have access to other variables.

So far that's really been it. Python is becoming pretty simple to read and understand what's going on. Soon I will be diving into API's and using some heavy imports so that way I get used to doing stuff like that.
